# 🛰️ DevFleet — Remote Server & Job Runner as a Service

**DevFleet** is a self-hosted, developer-focused **job orchestration platform**.  
Think of it as a hybrid between **GitHub Actions**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, and **Node-based cron job runners** — except it runs entirely on your infrastructure and is fully extensible.

> **Run and monitor scripts on any remote machine you control — securely, reliably, and with full observability.**

---

## 🔧 Use Cases

- Run shell commands across remote dev servers, edge devices, or cloud VMs
- Replace fragile SSH scripts with token-authenticated job agents
- Schedule cron jobs via a UI, with real-time logs and retry handling
- Self-hosted alternative to GitHub Actions, tailored to your infra

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

| Component      | Tech Stack             | Role |
|----------------|------------------------|------|
| Backend API    | Node.js + Express       | Manages jobs, agents, auth |
| Scheduler      | Node + Cron + BullMQ    | Schedules future jobs |
| Agent CLI      | Node.js + WebSocket     | Executes scripts on remote servers |
| Database       | PostgreSQL              | Stores jobs, runs, agents, logs |
| Queue          | Redis + BullMQ          | Dispatches jobs to runners |
| Frontend       | React (WIP)             | Dashboard to manage jobs and view logs |
| Network Layer  | Tailscale / Ngrok       | NAT-safe agent connectivity |

## 🔐 Agent Connectivity

### Option 1: Tailscale  
Use Tailscale for secure, NAT-safe, VPN-style connectivity.

### Option 2: Ngrok Reverse Tunnel  
If you can't install Tailscale, use ngrok or Cloudflare tunnels to expose the WebSocket endpoint.

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started (WIP)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/devfleet.git && cd devfleet

# Start the backend
pnpm install && pnpm dev

# Start the PostgreSQL + Redis
docker-compose up -d

# Connect your agent
npx devfleet-agent@latest connect --token <your-token>
